package is based on the folder and file name
the first struct defines the properties
adding instantiations makes them have default arguments
ending their name with a question mark makes them option constructor arguments.

Interfaces: 
    Keys - obj{key}
    Idxs - obj[idx]
    Add - obj + obj



within a type/module definition

Cnk:
Capture(String s) 


C:
Capture(word captureKey, String *s, Abstract *source)...

The captureKey is implied with the attachement to roebling, and the source is
implied by definingit within the type.



for adding the memctx it's a matter of if anything needs it.

Cnk (within a templ.cnk file):

_Add(String *s){
    this.content += s
}

C:
status Templ_Add(MemCtx *m, Templ *templ, String *s){
    String_Add(m, templ->content, s);
    return templ->type.state;
}
