<h1>Caneka</h1>

<h2>The Anti-Syntax Runtime</h2>

Caneka was born from the idea that customized syntaxes can unlock the true
potential of humans using computers.

Think of it like &quot;a regular expression engine that can generate and run data
structures&quot;.

The goal of this approach is to increase configuration and encourage teams to
map their problem space more directly, using less lines of boiler-plate code.

This is commonly refered to as a Domain Specific Language.

Since the dawn of computing, all computer tasks have been accomplished through
a combination of user-interaction, protocols, markups, and programming
langauges. Caneka aims to allow software development to include the definition
of the langauge syntax. 

For this analogy, here are examples from each category:

Protocols: DNS, HTTP, SMTP/LMTP
Protocols (binary): TLS, WebSockets, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, WiFi, Serial
Markups: CSV, XML, JSON, YAML, CBOR, HTML, LaTeX, PDF
Programming Langauges: Java, Python, TypeScript/Javascript, Go, Scala, Rust...

The comonality between items within each category speaks to the value of
customizaton, and also highlights the challenges of conformity.

<h2>Caneka Components</h2>

Caneka has three main components including a parser with no prefered syntax, a
network server, and a memory manager for data storage and data structures.

Components:

- *base*: includes virtual memory segmented strings,
  scalable arrays, a key-value lookup, and the memory manager.
- *ext*: All other features, including the class system
  found in *types*, are in the extended sources in the
  folder ext. This includes the *parser* and
  beginings of the *serve* folder. The server heavily
  leverages components in the *navigate* module.
  To see how a tcp/http server is componsed, view the
  *test* file as a good
  reference.
- *programs*: Any programs that ship with the source
  will be in this folder, presently *tests* is the
  only meaningful program in this folder.

see *caneka.org* for more details.

<h3>Build Instructions</h3>

To build and test Caneka run:

    ./scripts/test.sh

There are other scripts in the */scripts/* folder provide quick
commands.

Each folder within the *src* artifact folder, have a file in
them which controls how they are built. Either as one include file such as (in
the case of *base/inc.c* or with a more eleborate
&quot;build.c&quot; file. Every module after the &quot;base&quot; is built using the &quot;build.c&quot;
file, which is used by &quot;cnkbuild&quot; builder.

<h4>CnkBuild - source builder</h4>

Canka only requires a C compile to build. A small library is built to manage
the build configuration(s) (found in the *builder*
folder). Small files named &quot;build.c&quot; are found throughout the codebase which 
build the objects and executables for the runtime.

Further customization can be found in the *build.c*
file, and the &quot;build.c&quot; files for each program, such as the 
*test program*.

<h3>Build Status</h3>

The system is currently being updated to include a new base, all components
have worked in prototype form at one time or another, but it's currently a
shit-show.

<h3>Folder Layout</h3>

Because Caneka is intended to be written in another syntax and transpiled into
C, most of the actively developed source code is currently locaed in the
*artifact src folder*. This is because, over time, caneka will
be transpiled from it's own, more convienient syntax.

There is a sketch of the CanekaLang syntax for the *Str*
module, but it does not yet parser, it's what I've written as I begin to figure
out what the high-level syntax will look like.

Other examples of random things can be found in the *examples* folder.
